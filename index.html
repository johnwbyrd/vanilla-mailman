<p><em>If you don't understand anything else in this document, read this:</em> This 
software can only be installed and made operational by an engineer who
understands perl, PHP, MySQL and editing configuration files by hand.
This is not a piece of software that you can slam in and let 'er rip.
There are simply too many moving parts.  Patience and some testing
time will be necessary to make sure that all these parts interrelate
and work correctly with one another.  Moreover, I just don't have a ton
of time to support this software.</p>

<p>Comments and advice on how this software may be improved are very 
welcome; I encourage github pull requests and other patches to improve 
stability and compatibility. </p>

<h1>
<a name="about-this-software" class="anchor" href="#about-this-software"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About this software</h1>

<p>This is a set of scripts and logic for integrating the 
open-source version of <a href="http://www.vanillaforums.org">Vanilla Forum</a> 
with the GNU version of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/">Mailman version 
2.1</a>.  It allows <em>bi-directional
discussions</em> between e-mail and an online discussion forum.  Users may
talk with each other transparently via either the Vanilla web interface 
or via a mailman listserver.</p>

<h1>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h1>

<ul>
<li>Full bi-directional support for discussions and comments emanating 
from users participating via the Vanilla web forum interface or via 
Mailman's web email interface. Users may converse with one another via 
e-mail list or the Web interface, and the discussion is seamless to all 
parties. </li>
<li>Smart message reformatting. Messages from Vanilla are reformatted 
intelligently into text and HTML format emails. Message quoting and 
reformatting is automatically detected and converted into HTML when 
email is sent from Mailman into Vanilla. </li>
<li>Smart thread recovery and reconstruction. The software is able to 
figure out threading via e-mail discussions and appropriately 
reconstruct threads within Vanilla's comments structure, using the JWZ 
algorithm. </li>
<li>Integrated password management. Users may change Mailman list 
properties entirely from within Vanilla, including setting no-mail, 
digest, HTML versus plain text emails, and receive own mailing flags. 
Additionally, changing the password for a user within Vanilla updates 
the corresponding password within Mailman. </li>
<li>Free (and worth every penny).</li>
</ul><h1>
<a name="installation-requirements" class="anchor" href="#installation-requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation requirements</h1>

<p>Integrating a web-based discussion forum with an email list is a 
non-trivial task with many corner cases. Therefore this software has 
some strong opinions on how this integration should be accomplished. </p>

<p>First, the versions of Mailman as well as Vanilla are highly specific. 
Mailman must be of the 2.1+ variety, with the modifications described 
herein; the new 3.0 branch is currently guaranteed not to work with this 
implementation, because this implementation accesses MySQL databases in 
which both Mailman and Vanilla store their details directly. </p>

<p>This system was designed to run on a single CentOS 6.4 installation with 
command-line and root access. Later versions of CentOS 6.x might work, 
but the installation steps may vary from the steps described in 
this document. In this installation, the Vanilla Forum, as well as the 
mailman server, are intended to run on the same physical machine; 
however there is no techical reason why this must be the case, as long 
as the shared MySQL database is accessible to both the server running 
Vanilla as well as the server running Mailman. However, a dual-server 
installation has not been tested. </p>

<h1>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h1>

</ul><h1>
<a name="install-centos-prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#install-centos-prerequisites"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install CentOS prerequisites</h1>

<p>This installation was conducted on CentOS 6.4 Final, with:</p>

<pre><code># yum upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>run on it as of August 23 2013.</p>

<p>First, install EPEL.  Generic instructions on how to set up EPEL are <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F">here.</a></p>

<p>At this point, install several prerequisites at once:</p>

<pre><code># yum install gcc make httpd mysql-devel perl-CPAN php-mysql php53-string php-cli mysql-server python-devel MySQL-python
</code></pre>

<p>and accept all prerequisites to be installed.</p>

<p>At this point you need to set (if you haven't already) a MySQL root 
password. Generic instructions on how to do this are 
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/resetting-permissions.html">here.</a> 
However, I found it easiest to do this by running the script that was 
automatically installed at: </p>

<pre><code># /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
</code></pre>

<p>This script allows you to set a root password for MySQL.</p>

<p>MySQL seems to want to open a port 3306 when it is installed; this is 
likely not what you want. To disable this, add this to the end of 
/etc/my.cnf: </p>

<pre><code># Stop permitting access from any IP address
[mysqld]
bind-address=127.0.0.1
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure the services start at boot time as well:</p>

<pre><code># chkconfig mysqld on
# chkconfig httpd on
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="install-epel-and-phpmyadmin" class="anchor" href="#install-epel-and-phpmyadmin"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install EPEL and phpMyAdmin</h2>

<p>This step is recommended but not strictly necessary. If you don't do this though you'll 
need to have another preferred method for viewing and administrating the 
MySQL database you just installed. Generic instructions on how to set up 
EPEL are <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F">here.</a></p>

<p>Once you've done this, you can type</p>

<pre><code># yum install phpMyAdmin
</code></pre>

<p>to install phpMyAdmin.</p>

<p>The default installation of phpMyAdmin via EPEL is extremely 
restrictive. You may wish to edit /etc/httpd/conf.d/phpMyAdmin.conf so 
that your IP address is permitted to access it remotely: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;IfModule !mod_authz_core.c&gt;
    # Apache 2.2
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from All
    Allow from 127.0.0.1
    Allow from your.ip.address.here
    Allow from ::1
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore, the default httpd.conf file limits the ability of the .htaccess file
which was part of Vanilla to do prettier URLs.  To fix this and restore
pretty URLs, look in the section of /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf that starts with
 and modify the AllowOverride directive from None
to All:</p>

<pre><code>AllowOverride All
</code></pre>

<p>Once you've edited that file, restart httpd:</p>

<pre><code>service httpd restart
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="optional-install-mutt" class="anchor" href="#optional-install-mutt"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Optional: install mutt</h3>

<p>This software reads and parses e-mail using the Maildir directory 
format. One mail client that reads and writes this format, and hence is 
useful for debugging, is the mutt mail reader. </p>

<pre><code># yum install mutt
</code></pre>

<p>After installing mutt, you can read and view email for any particular 
user more easily by setting up either a user-specific .muttrc file or a 
system-wide /etc/Muttrc file with contents something like the following: </p>

<pre><code>set mbox_type = Maildir
set spoolfile = "~/Maildir"
set folder = '~/Maildir' # default: '~/Mail'
set from = 'this.user@yourmailserver.com' # default: ''
set visual = 'nano' # default: ''
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="remove-sendmail-and-install-postfix" class="anchor" href="#remove-sendmail-and-install-postfix"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Remove sendmail and install postfix</h2>

<pre><code># yum erase sendmail
# yum install postfix
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, you'll need to edit the default postfix settings in 
/etc/postfix/main.cf . Sanity check all the settings in this file, but 
in particular to get this working with Mailman you'll also need to set 
the <em>myhostname</em> setting in main.cf to be the publicly available 
hostname of your server: </p>

<pre><code>myhostname = your.hostname.com
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the people who wrote this distribution thought it was a good idea 
that it should not actually send and receive mail from the Internet, so 
you have to change this default: </p>

<pre><code>inet_interfaces = all
</code></pre>

<p>Uncomment the recipient_delimiter line, which Mailman uses to handle bounces:</p>

<pre><code>recipient_delimiter = +
</code></pre>

<p>This system uses Maildir style mailboxes to hold traffic to and from the 
forum, so uncomment the Maildir home_mailbox option: </p>

<pre><code>home_mailbox = Maildir/
</code></pre>

<h1>
<a name="install-mailman" class="anchor" href="#install-mailman"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install mailman</h1>

<p><em>IMPORTANT!</em> Do <em>NOT</em> use yum to install mailman. It's necessary to 
change a lot of the default settings from the way that the CentOS 
distribution does this by default. So download the latest Mailman 2.1 
sources from the GNU distribution: </p>

<pre><code># cd ~
# wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mailman/mailman-2.1.16rc2.tgz
# tar xfvz mailman-2.1.16rc2.tgz
# cd mailman-2.1.16rc2
# useradd -c "Mailman" -s /sbin/nologin -U mailman
# chmod a+rx,g+ws /var/lib/mailman
# ./configure --with-cgi-gid=apache --with-mail-gid=mailman --with-var-prefix=/var/lib/mailman --with-mailhost=your.mailhost.com --with-urlhost=your.mailmanurl.com
# make
# make install
</code></pre>

<p>Enable an administrative mailing list:</p>

<pre><code># cd /usr/local/mailman/bin
# ./newlist mailman
# ./config_list -i /usr/local/mailman/data/sitelist.cfg
</code></pre>

<a name="teach-httpd-to-display-mailman-scripts" class="anchor" href="#teach-httpd-to-display-mailman-scripts"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Teach httpd to display mailman scripts</h2>

<p>Teach httpd that it should use the Mailman scripts to display web pages. 
Copy the mailman.conf file from the Mailman-2.1 changes directory to the 
/etc/httpd/conf.d directory, or use it as a guide to set up your own 
mailman.conf file on the server. </p>

<h2>
<a name="set-up-mm_cfgpy" class="anchor" href="#set-up-mm_cfgpy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Set up mm_cfg.py</h2>

<p>Copy mm_cfg.py from the mailman-2.1 changes directory to 
/usr/local/mailman/Mailman on the remote server. This file will need to 
be edited to set the fully qualified domain name of the server and email 
hosts: </p>

<pre><code>fqdn = 'your.mailman.com'
DEFAULT_URL_HOST   = 'your.mailman.com'
DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST = 'your.mailman.com'

# Because we've overriden the virtual hosts above add_virtualhost
# MUST be called after they have been defined.

add_virtualhost(DEFAULT_URL_HOST, DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST)
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="set-up-aliases-for-postfix" class="anchor" href="#set-up-aliases-for-postfix"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Set up aliases for postfix</h2>

<p>In /etc/postfix/main.cf, tweak the alias_maps line:</p>

<pre><code>alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases, hash:/var/lib/mailman/data/aliases
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="copy-magic-files-into-mailman-install" class="anchor" href="#copy-magic-files-into-mailman-install"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Copy magic files into Mailman install</h2>

<p>For each mailing list that you create, you'll need to copy the extend.py 
file from the Mailman-2.1 changes folder in the distribution into each 
subdirectory that exists within /var/lib/mailman/lists/ that you want to 
share with the online web forum. This extend.py file tells Mailman to 
use the MySQL adapter to list the users that will be present in that 
particular mailing list. </p>

<p>Additionally, copy the MySqlMemberships.py file from the Mailman-2.1 
changes folder into the /usr/local/mailman/Mailman directory. This is 
the MySQL adapter file that causes Mailman to read from the MySQL 
database instead of a Python pickle for getting the user list. </p>

<p>Once you've done these things you'll need to restart Mailman to use these
new files:</p>

<pre><code># /usr/local/bin/mailman/bin/mailmanctl restart
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, if you have correctly set everything up, there should be 
a new table in the database called GDN_mailman_mysql which contains names
for each of the mailman users.</p>

<p>Note: on my installation I had to enable all permissions globally for
/root/.python-eggs in order to proceed.  Another way of getting the same 
result would be to edit extend.py with the following information:</p>

<pre><code>import os
os.environ['PYTHON_EGG_CACHE']='/path/to/egg/cache'
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="finish-mailman-installation" class="anchor" href="#finish-mailman-installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Finish mailman installation</h2>

<p>At this point, you'll have to do the remaining manual steps for 
installing Mailman, including <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-install/node41.html">installing the 
crontab</a> as well as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-install/node42.html">installing and starting the default 
service.</a> Also, you'll need to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-install/node44.html">create site and list 
passwords.</a> </p>

<p>Make sure that you can log in and administrate your mailing list via the 
Mailman web interface at the <a href="http://your.site.com/mailman">http://your.site.com/mailman</a> address. Also, 
now would be a good time to verify that mail coming into and out of your 
mailing list works normally as well. </p>

<h2>
<a name="install-your-own-mailing-lists" class="anchor" href="#install-your-own-mailing-lists"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install your own mailing list(s)</h2>

<p>At this point, you'll need to teach Mailman about any mailing lists that 
you want Mailman to manage. Create your mailing lists in the usual 
fashion using the Mailman web interface.  See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-install/node45.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-install/node45.html</a> 
for more details.  Also verify that your mailing lists operate nominally
as mailing lists before proceeding.</p>

<a name="set-up-anti-spam-protection-for-your-list" class="anchor" href="#set-up-anti-spam-protection-for-your-list"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Set up anti-spam protection for your list</h1>

<p>While it is not strictly necessary to set up anti-spam features for your mailing list,
the vast majority of modern mail services will immediately mark your mail as spam
unless you install some modern services on your postfix mail server.  These include
at least SPF, DKIM and possibly DMARC.</p>

<h2>
<a name="set-up-spf" class="anchor" href="#set-up-spf"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Set up SPF</h2>

<p>While setting up an SPF record for your domain is beyond the scope of this document,
some general advice is in order.  If you are running your own mail server, as this 
document assumes, then you will need to add a TXT record with the (short) host name
of your mail server, and a TXT record with a value like</p>

<pre><code>v=spf1 mx -all
</code></pre>

<p>For more information on how to design an SPF record, see <a href="http://www.openspf.org/Tools">http://www.openspf.org/Tools</a>
and/or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/safety/content/technologies/senderid/wizard/">http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/safety/content/technologies/senderid/wizard/</a>

<h2>
<a name="set-up-dkim" class="anchor" href="#set-up-dkim"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Set up DKIM</h2>

<p>As root, install the OpenDKIM package:</p>

<pre><code># yum install opendkim
</code></pre>

<p>Restart the opendkim daemon:</p>

<pre><code># service opendkim restart
</code></pre>

<p>This in turn will automatically generate 1024-bit keys for you:</p>

<pre><code>Stopping OpenDKIM Milter:                                  [FAILED]
Generating default DKIM keys:                              [  OK  ]
Default DKIM keys for yourserver.com created in /etc/opendkim/keys.
Starting OpenDKIM Milter:                                  [  OK  ]
</code></pre>

<p>Now edit /etc/opendkim.conf.  Set the operating mode to s (signer):</p>

<pre><code>Mode  s
</code></pre>

<p>And set the domain you're signing for, i.e. the domain of the mail server:</p>

<pre><code>Domain  your.mailserver.com
</code></pre>

<p>Add the following line (if necessary) to permit signing from any subdomains
within your domain:</p>

<pre><code>Subdomains yes
</code></pre>

<p>Uncomment the InternalHosts file location:</p>

<pre><code>InternalHosts   refile:/etc/opendkim/TrustedHosts
</code></pre>

<p>Next, edit /etc/postfix/main.cf and add the following information, which queries
the local OpenDKIM server from within postfix:</p>

<pre><code>smtpd_milters = inet:127.0.0.1:8891
non_smtpd_milters = $smtpd_milters
milter_default_action = accept
milter_protocol = 2
</code></pre>

<p>Restart opendkim and then restart postfix:</p>

<pre><code># service restart opendkim
# service restart postfix
</code></pre>

<p>The best tool I've found for designing a DMARC record for your domain is
at <a href="http://www.unlocktheinbox.com/dmarcwizard/">http://www.unlocktheinbox.com/dmarcwizard/</a>.  Again you'll need
to modify your TXT records for your domain in question.</p>

<p>Many modern e-mail services will reject your e-mail just for not having
reverse DNS set up appropriately.  Make sure that reverse DNS is working
correctly for your domain.</p>

<p>Once you have done all this, e-mail sent from your postfix mail server
to a mail testing service, such as that at <a href="http://www.mail-tester.com/">http://www.mail-tester.com/</a>,
should indicate that your e-mail is spam-free.</p>

<h1>
<a name="install-vanilla-forum" class="anchor" href="#install-vanilla-forum"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install Vanilla forum</h1>

<p>Install the 2.2.3.5 version of Vanilla into the /var/www/html directory 
on the server. Later or other versions may or may not work with the 
Vanilla plugin for Mailman. You'll need to set up a Vanilla-specific 
user on MySQL in order to do this; I found phpMyAdmin very helpful, but 
it's also possible via the command line as well. </p>

<h2>
<a name="optional-install-xdebug" class="anchor" href="#optional-install-xdebug"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Optional: install xdebug</h2>

<p>This step may be skipped if everything works the way you expect, but if 
for some reason the Mailman plugin misbehaves, installing xdebug on the 
web server can be used to help debug the plugin. If you've installed 
EPEL, you can at this point install xdebug in a straightforward manner: </p>

<pre><code>yum install php-pecl-xdebug
</code></pre>

<p>Now xdebug.so lives in /usr/lib64/php/modules/xdebug.so .</p>

<p>At this point you will need to tweak xdebug for your installation, via editing /etc/php.d/xdebug.ini:</p>

<pre><code>; Enable xdebug extension module
zend_extension=/usr/lib64/php/modules/xdebug.so
xdebug.remote_enable=On
; xdebug.remote_autostart=On
xdebug.remote_handler=dbgp
; developer workstation IP address
xdebug.remote_host=1.2.3.4
xdebug.remote_port=9000
xdebug.remote_mode=req
</code></pre>

<p>Then restart the web server:</p>

<pre><code># service httpd restart
</code></pre>

<p>Debugging a PHP installation is beyond the scope of this document, but I used Eclipse
and SFTP to develop and debug the Vanilla plugin.  </p>

<h2>
<a name="install-necessary-vanilla-plugins" class="anchor" href="#install-necessary-vanilla-plugins"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install necessary Vanilla plugins</h2>

<p>The following plugins must be installed into Vanilla for this system to work:</p>

<pre><code>Logger
UsefulFunctions
</code></pre>

<p>To install these plugins, download them from 
<a href="http://www.vanillaforums.org">http://www.vanillaforums.org</a> and copy the directories into the 
/var/www/html/plugins directory on the server. Case is important -- make 
sure the directories are capitalized. Additionally, copy the Mailman 
folder onto the server, also into /var/www/html/plugins . </p>

<p>The following plugin may optionally be installed:</p>

<pre><code>ForceGuestSignIn
</code></pre>

<p>Note that there is as of this writing a bug in the ForceGuestSignIn 
plugin that causes the plugin not to work correctly. In default.php, 
find the line labelled </p>

<pre><code>header('location:/entry')
</code></pre>

<p>and replace it with </p>

<pre><code>Redirect('entry');
</code></pre>

<p>and your plugin would work with configurations that are installed not in 
the root. </p>

<h2>
<a name="install-the-mailman-plugin" class="anchor" href="#install-the-mailman-plugin"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install the Mailman plugin</h2>

<p>Copy the Mailman directory provided in this system to the Vanilla 
plugins directory at /var/www/html/plugins . Then log on to Vanilla as 
the Vanilla administrator and go to the Vanilla dashboard. Under the 
Addons tab, select Plugins. You should see an entry for the Mailman

<p>Now that you've installed Vanilla and mailman, you can get them talking 
to one another.  The first step to doing this is to make sure users
can authenticate against the mailman database of users.</p>

<h2>
<a name="create-a-mailman-user-that-can-access-the-vanilla-database" class="anchor" href="#create-a-mailman-user-that-can-access-the-vanilla-database"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Create a mailman user that can access the Vanilla database</h2>

<p>Using the phpMyAdmin interface at <a href="http://yourserver.com/phpMyAdmin">http://yourserver.com/phpMyAdmin</a> in
order to create a user named mailman.  Assign this user a secure password.
Grant database specific privileges to the mailman user so that the user
can make any changes to the vanilla database.  (If you've chosen a
different name for the default Vanilla database you'll need to assign
them accordingly here.)</p>

<p>Check and modify the MySQL settings in 
/usr/local/mailman/Mailman/mm_cfg.py. You've edited this file before but 
you'll need to do it again for this phase: </p>

<pre><code>MYSQL_MEMBER_DB_NAME = "vanilla"
MYSQL_MEMBER_DB_USER = "mailman"
MYSQL_MEMBER_DB_PASS = "YourSecurePassword"
MYSQL_MEMBER_DB_HOST = "localhost"
MYSQL_MEMBER_TABLE_TYPE = "flat"
MYSQL_MEMBER_TABLE_NAME = "GDN_mailman_mysql"
</code></pre>

<p>Change these fields according to your particular installation; at least 
you will need to change the password to be the one you chose in the 
previous step. </p>

<p>At this point you should be able to log into Vanilla as any user you
create for a mailman mailing list.  Verify that you can change
user settings such as mail delivery within a user's profile and see
these changes occurring in the corresponding MySQL database before
proceeding.</p>

<h1>
<a name="gate-email-from-the-mailman-into-vanilla" class="anchor" href="#gate-email-from-the-mailman-into-vanilla"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gate email from the mailman into Vanilla</h1>

<p>For each mailing list, you're going to first create a gateway user 
account that can read and write the MySQL database. Then, you'll add the 
gateway user account to the mailman mailing list so that mail sent 
through the list will arrive at the user account.  Lastly you'll set
up a cron job so that the mailman plugin's tick function is called
regularly, and incoming e-mail is parsed and sent to Vanilla regularly.</p>

<p>Using phpMyAdmin, create a MySQL user with the name vanillagate and 
a secure password.  Grant all privileges to the vanillagate MySQL 
user to the vanilla database.</p>

<h2>
<a name="create-a-gateway-user-account" class="anchor" href="#create-a-gateway-user-account"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Create a gateway user account</h2>

<pre><code># useradd vanillagate
# passwd vanillagate
(set a different secure password here)
</code></pre>

<p>At this point if you haven't done so login as the vanillagate user to 
continue configuring the parser.  All this installation will be done as
the vanillagate user, to avoid installing a ton of CPAN modules as root.</p>

<p>Copy the Module/Emails-Parser directory to the vanillagate user's 
account.  The perl module should exist at /home/vanillagate/Emails-Parser
after completion.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~vanillagate/Emails-Parser
$ ls 
inc  lib  Makefile.PL  MANIFEST  parse-emails.conf  parse-emails.pl
$ chown -R vanillagate.vanillagate *
</code></pre>

<p>Now you're ready to install Emails-Parser:</p>

<pre><code>$ cpanm .
</code></pre>

<p>This will take a while.  After this is concluded you should be able 
to run the parsing email script:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~
$ perl Emails-Parser/parse-emails.pl
</code></pre>

<p>You will get an error about being unable to connect to the database.
Edit the file Emails-Parser/parse-emails.conf:</p>

<pre><code>dbhost = localhost
dbname = vanilla
dbuser = vanillagate
dbpass = thesecuremysqlpassword
mailboxtype = maildir
mailfolder = /home/vanillagate/Maildir
maillistname = yourmailinglistname
dbtrace = 0
</code></pre>

<p>Edit each of the fields in parse-emails.conf accordingly.  At this
point, running the parse-emails.pl perl script should connect to the 
database:</p>

<pre><code>WARNING: Folder does not exist, failed opening maildir folder /home/vanillagate/Maildir.
</code></pre>

<p>You may optionally set dbtrace to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Etimb/DBI/DBI.pm#TRACING">a number described in the DBI.pm perl 
module</a> to detect and 
debug database connection issues, if necessary; set it back to 0 when 
you're done. </p>

<p>At this point you're ready to add the vanillagate user to the mailman

<p>First, make sure you're logged onto an account that can edit permissions 
of files in the Vanilla web directory. </p>

<p>In order to run the Vanilla tick job, the tick program needs to be able 
to write to the directory plugins/UsefulFunctions/bin . Yes this is a 
silly and unnecessary security hole. Just do it and don't think about it 
too much. </p>

<pre><code>cd /var/www/html
cd plugins/UsefulFunctions
chmod 777 bin
</code></pre>

<p>Log on as the vanillagate user. Run the following commands at the shell 
prompt as the vanillagate user: </p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/perl /home/vanillagate/Emails-Parser/parse-emails.pl
</code></pre>

<p>That command should produce only a single line of output:</p>

<pre><code>Pushing messages to forum: 100% [====================================]D 0h00m00s
</code></pre>

<p>Next, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/php -q /var/www/html/plugins/UsefulFunctions/bin/tick.php
</code></pre>

<p>There should be no error messages appearing. If error messages appear in 
either of those outputs, figure out why before proceeding; error 
messages appearing in either command will cause a series of exciting 
cascading errors when you go to the next step. </p>

<h2>
<a name="install-cron-jobs-for-vanillagate" class="anchor" href="#install-cron-jobs-for-vanillagate"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install cron jobs for vanillagate</h2>

<p>Copy the vanillagate-job.bash file from the cron directory from this 
package into the root directory of the vanillagate user, at 
/home/vanillagate. You may review the contents of this file if you wish. </p>

<p>Set the permissions correctly on the file:</p>

<pre><code>chmod 755 vanillagate-job.bash
</code></pre>

<p>Set your favorite text editor via the command prompt first:</p>

<pre><code>export EDITOR=nano
</code></pre>

<p>Next, edit the crontab file for the vanillagate user:</p>

<pre><code>crontab -e
</code></pre>

<p>When the editor appears, add the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>*/5 * * * * /home/vanillagate/vanillagate-job.bash
</code></pre>

<p>Since you're editing a crontab, you can adjust the first digit in each 
line to describe how frequently these jobs should be run. I'm running 
them every 5 minutes here. </p>

<p>If all goes well, you should be in business now. Try gating some e-mails 
back and forth from the Web interface to the mailing list, and vice 
versa. </p>

<p>For extra security, you may now set the vanillagate's user shell to 
/sbin/nologin if you wish by editing /etc/passwd as the root user.</p>
